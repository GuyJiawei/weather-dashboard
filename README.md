# Weather Dashboard

## General Info
This week's challenge was to build a weather app from scratch.

- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Challenges
My whole house caught COVID and I was in the middle of the group project. Time crunch meant that I could only manage the main functionality and lost time finishing the search history buttons.
